{NGINX} configuration files for services on running on my various devices.

== Synopsis

These instructions are for using this NGINX configuration via a container using rootless {Podman} on {Fedora-IoT}.
The instructions for building will assume that you are on Fedora.

== Usage

. Allow rootless containers to publish to ports 80 and 443 by lowering the starting port for the range of unprivileged ports to which users are allowed to publish.
+
./etc/sysctl.d/99-ip_unprivileged_port_start.conf
[,ini]
----
; Allow publishing to lower port numbers without requiring superuser privileges.
net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
----

. Load the new sysctl configuration.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo sysctl --system
----

. Open the default HTTP and HTTPS ports in the firewall, since rootless Podman won't be able to open this for us.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp --add-port=443/tcp  --permanent
----

. Reload the firewall rules that were just saved.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

. Clone the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone git@github.com:jwillikers/nginx-config.git
----

. Change into the project directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd nginx-config
----

. Symlink sites from the `sites-available` subdirectory to the `sites-enabled` subdirectory to enable them.
+
[,sh]
----
ln --relative --symbolic sites-available/electrs.conf sites-enabled/electrs.conf
----

. Mount the configuration files inside the NGINX container when running like in the following example.
+
[,sh]
----
podman run \
  --detach \
  --label "io.containers.autoupdate=registry" \
  --network podman \
  --name nginx \
  --publish 80:80/tcp \
  --publish 443:443/tcp \
  --rm \
  --volume $PWD:/etc/nginx/:ro,Z \
  --volume certbot-data:/etc/nginx/ssl:ro,z \
  docker.io/nginx:latest
----

== Develop

. Install the pre-commit in the toolbox.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo dnf -y install pre-commit
----

. Install pre-commit's Git hooks.
+
[,sh]
----
pre-commit install
----
